# Reading-Notes
Notes:

## Growth mindset:
know when to step away, reminds me of the fresh mind theory when trying to solve puzzles. Nothing is really impossible its just a matter of staying calm and having the right data. Recognize when you are stuck somewhere and also know when to ask for help. Teams should complement eachother and be a source of inspiration. Negativity should be left out, genuinely.

**my own words**

1. Don't spend too much time on a problem.
2. ~~Are ordered lists lame?~~

Column a? | Column b? | Column c?

> It felt like fumbling in the dark for a while, at first i had a hard time figuring out how to properly download and install VScode and which brew. the guide worked out well eventually and i was able to go back and troubleshoot, getting the command "code" to bring up vscode.

> using a notepad is also a much more low tech way of remembering certain command lines that a good to know, reading something is great, but typing/writing things out make it easier to absorb.
