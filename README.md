## Notes: Code 102

> Im Olivier, this is weird for me because getting my hands dirty and being on my feet all day is more common to me than reading and typing. It was time to get more serious about making changes and try and transition into tech from the service industry. I'm a trained fine artist which pretty much means I'm skilled at hobbling things together, sometimes out of odd ends that might not be intended to come together to make something new and hopefully useful.
