Notes:

Growth mindset:
know when to step away, reminds me of the fresh mind theory when trying to solve puzzles. Nothing is really impossible its just a matter of staying calm and having the right data. Recognize when you are stuck somewhere and also know when to ask for help. Teams should complement eachother and be a source of inspiration. Negativity should be left out, genuinely.
