## REST

> When there is a free-flow of data, teams can be more successful. When members of a group are likened as 'the smart bunch', they tend to be less collaborative and choose to act like individuals. Success is often built on experiences, which cannot be optimized. Approaches that seek to optimize everything are not allowing for the psychological safety of the team. 

> Roy Fielding is one of the creators of HTTP, the protocol used to make the internet work. And that protocol is built using an architectural style call "REST". REST stands for Representational State Transfer. The idea is that resources (data) can be transferred as a represention, like HTML (for people) or JSON (for computers).

> To use this concept, a server needs to be able to respond when a client asks for something. This is a GET request. The client asks to GET some data and that data is then transferred in a consistent representation. Consistency allows for the client to know what they have to do to work with the data.

  - **REST**
    - architectural style that the internet is built on
  - **URL**
    - tells the browser a concept exists somewhere
    - lets machines that are using different languages communicate
  - **API**
    - communicate over the internet
