## Day 2 Notes##

> Getting familiar with the terminal and starting to push away from relying on the GUI and pointer. It is reminding me of learning a new language and having to simiultaneously learn cutural mannerisms.

> Merging the page and info from github to my local drive was simpler than initially thought.

> Cloning repository and adding to it via VSCode is gonna take some practice.

> Having an intial issue with pushing a saved VSCode change into github I double backed and actually followed the prompts in the terminal when a command didnt work at first. I also became aware of what happens when you forget certain characters including spaces and quotations. eventually freezing everything but the old addage of unplug it, wait three seconds and start over worked great. Restarting terminal and i was able to push through the section that was originially giving me grief. If you can read this then i was able to duplicate this action. otherwise my mac will be in lake sammamish..

> inserting a hyperlink to an image, only not from the interwebs but locally making sure the image file type is jpeg or jpg `it is kinda the same` all of this is still a hot mess and im skipping around kind of jumping in with both feet i should be reading more but im noticing that i managed get through the protein of the lab by fumbling around until it worked the important lesson was add commit push. add the changes, commit them to be pushed into the git
