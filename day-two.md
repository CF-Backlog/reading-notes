## Day 2 Notes##

> Getting familiar with the terminal and starting to push away from relying on the GUI and pointer. It is reminding me of learning a new language and having to simiultaneously learn cutural mannerisms.

> Merging the page and info from github to my local drive was simpler than initially thought.

> Cloning repository and adding to it via VSCode is gonna take some practice.

> Having an intial issue with pushing a saved VSCode change into github I double backed and actually followed the prompts in the terminal when a command didnt work at first. I also became aware of what happens when you forget certain characters including spaces and quotations. eventually freezing everything but the old addage of unplug it, wait three seconds and start over worked great. Restarting terminal and i was able to push through the section that was originially giving me grief. If you can read this then i was able to duplicate this action. otherwise my mac will be in lake sammamish..
