## Day 2 Notes##

> Getting familiar with the terminal and starting to push away from relying on the GUI and pointer. It is reminding me of learning a new language and having to simiultaneously learn cutural mannerisms.

> Merging the page and info from github to my local drive was simpler than initially thought.

> Cloning repository and adding to it via VSCode is gonna take some practice.
