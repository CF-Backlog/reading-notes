# Redux - Combined Reducers

Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

What is the purpose of a reducer?

What does an action contain?

Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?


immutable state - state that cannot be changed
time travel in redux - undo function that reverts the state to what it was prior to the action
action creator - plain function that returns an action object
reducer - function that determines changes to an appl state
dispatch - function of a Redux store, triggers a state change.
