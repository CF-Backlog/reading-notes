# Event Driven Applications

Why is access control important?
Not every user holds the same skill level or clearance to access what could potentially be sensitive data.

Describe an application that would need access control.
Anything that deals with sensitive data. I. E. medical information, credit and financial.

What is a role used for?
This is how access to a given user would be defined.

Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
It decreases the amount of work needed to give access by making the role assigned to a user have the correct permissions, as opposed to each user being adjusted.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Term

Authorization - id based permission
Role Based Access Control - roles have varying clearances these roles are asigned to users depending on what they are meant to do.
Capabilities - what any given user is authorized to do.
