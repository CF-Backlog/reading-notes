Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
> It is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. Done in order to provide coordinated access to a certain resource, throughout an entire software system.

Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
> Singleton can be used with node modules to create a single constructor in it's own file that can be reused across an app in varying files.

If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
> It would first have to be determined what the software would be used for, who the target user is and their needs, and proceed to prototype possible iterations based on user scenarios.
