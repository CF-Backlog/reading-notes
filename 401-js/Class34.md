Why is the Context API useful?
> sometimes you want to pass a state prop directly to a specific element or object nested deep in the family, instead of wasting time with pushing them down each level

Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
> yes, properly imported and passed through the top of the target page

What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
> setting roles, doing stuff, sometimes a state needs to have its fingers in multiple pies across an app

Describe “Context Hell”
> too many layers passing data, like when those nested for loops get completely out of hand

global state - top level state passed via props
global context - similar to state but available directly to the child components 
provider - pattern used in context to share data 
consumer - consumer takes in a child as f(x) and returns node
