# Routing

Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
> yes using .props

When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
> I dont have a clear answer for this one yet

<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>

Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
> this can be rendered by other parents, in vue it can be reused over and over 

What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
> spread allows the child to use parent props

props.children - parent prop, used to render all childrens
composition - an app composed of components built off of eachother allowing for a uniqueness and complexity.
