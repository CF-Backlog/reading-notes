Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
Focuses productivity, Neater code, Safer refactoring, understanding before hand if dependencies are necessary.

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
They can be used if the same bit of code needs to be run multiple times.

What is one downside of Test Driven Development
Takes time away from writing code.

Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
Neater lines of code, and the Es6 classes take the functionality of Constructors/prototypes and adds a dash of flexibility.

Why REST?
Why not?
