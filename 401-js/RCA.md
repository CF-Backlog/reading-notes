# Root Cause Analysis:

> I found a couple of repos I would like to look into, but I have not had the time to look into it in more depth yet. It will be a good practice in sussing out a potential issue with no clear guidance as to what an outside contribution could look like or is needed. 

> What can I contribute?

> How do I find out what needs to change?

> What can be fixed?

> How can I provide clarity?
