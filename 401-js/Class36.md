What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
> Cookies are not only delicious but they are more secure than local storage.

Explain 3rd party cookies.
> That fun stuff that allows for tracking and essentially targeted advertising.

cookies - like local storage but way tastier and more secure.

access control - essentially creates tiers of access permissions so employees, depending on roles, just fit into a tier
conditional rendering - if this condition is met then the awesome thing happens.
